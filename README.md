# TripNLP
An investigation into the weird and wonderful experiences people have under the influence of drugs.


## TODO Analyses

2. Explore dose, age & gender distributions & patterns
3. Topic modelling
4. Word embeddings & TSNE
5. Ratio of general:difficult experiences:bad trips:train wrecks & trip disasters:glowing experiences:mystical experiences: health benfits
6. Sentiment analysis comparing general category for different drugs
7. Classifier for top terms for each of the above categories

8. Text generation to create fake trip description
  - Maybe check out Markovify - https://github.com/jsvine/markovify
9. Comparing words/phrases for recent versus older reports - changing usage/experiences?
  - Or drug popularity over time?
  - need to account for site popularity over time (total drug reports per year?)

10. For each drug, network analysis of which other drugs they are most frequently combined with (simple counts as edge weight). Will need to scrape the index for all drug experiences


# Done
1. Date parsing to see reports over time
