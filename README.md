# TripNLP
An investigation into the weird and wonderful experiences people have under the influence of drugs.


## TODO Analyses
- For each drug, network analysis of which other drugs they are most frequently combined with (simple counts as edge weight). Might need to scrape the report for ALL mentioned drugs for this to be thorough
- Date parsing to see reports over time
- Comparing words/phrases for recent versus older reports - changing usage/experiences?
- Explore dose, age & gender distributions & patterns
- Vector embeddings to investigate relationships using vector math
- Text generation to create fake trip description
